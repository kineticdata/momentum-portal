## Signature Widget

The signature widget renders a signature element, which opens a modal where the user can draw their signature. That signature is the stored as an image in an attachment field on the form.

```js
// Initialize the Markdown widget
bundle.widgets.Signature({ container, field, config, id });

// Retrieve a reference to the widget's API
bundle.widgets.Signature.get(id);
```
